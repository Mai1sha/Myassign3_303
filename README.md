# Myassign3_303
I have kept three main for three questions(main1.cpp, main2.cpp, main3.cpp); a header file(queue3030.h) for the declarations and cpp for the definations(queue303.cpp).

Questions1:
I have implemented a queue using linked list and implemented push() pop(),front(),size() and empty() functions. The queue is a template type T so it can wrk with any data types. Instantiated the queue and pushed 10 values. Using the functions push, pop, front, display the values. Used a new function move_to_rear that moves the element currently at the front of the queue to the rear of the queue.The first part works fine.<img width="1082" alt="Screenshot 2024-04-04 at 11 05 21 PM" src="https://github.com/Mai1sha/Myassign3_303/assets/123522545/b924f9d3-8797-4ee7-82e6-26f25ff43785">

Questions2:
Used recersive linear search function to find the last occurance of a value. Instantiated a vector and pushed random values. Then called the recursive function to find the last occurance.It prints -1 if I search a value which is not in the vector. Searching a value within the vector shows the last occurance.<img width="828" alt="Screenshot 2024-04-04 at 11 10 20 PM" src="https://github.com/Mai1sha/Myassign3_303/assets/123522545/180cf934-01fd-4561-998a-70131950f088">

Question3:
Modified the source code for the insertion sort so that it can sort a linked list
 of integers.
